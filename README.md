## Description

As developers we create numerous projects all the time, therefore it is important to have a good quality and easy to follow README file with the information about the project you are working on so that other developers can contribute and understand your project. A command line application like this one will allow developers to create such a README file quickly and efficiently, so that developers can focus on other more important things.
